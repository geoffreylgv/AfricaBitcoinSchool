We saw how to install a wallet[Bitcoin](https://coinacademy.fr/bitcoin-btc-fondamental/)to receive and send bitcoins, now is the time to get some bitcoins and finally get down to business!

In this part, you will discover the different ways to obtain bitcoins, then we will make a purchase of bitcoins online. Finally, we will transfer these bitcoins to our Blockstream Green or Exodus wallet in order to maintain full control of our funds.

Indeed, if you buy bitcoins on an online exchange and leave them there, they do not belong to you.

In the event of hacking of the platform, bankruptcy of the company responsible for the platform or change in laws, you are exposed to the risk of partial or total loss of your funds. It is therefore important to take responsibility for the safety of your money today.

## **The different ways to obtain bitcoins**

There are several ways to obtain bitcoins. Here are some of the most common methods:

- Buying on exchanges: You can buy bitcoins on online exchanges such as Coinbase,[Binance](https://coinacademy.fr/exchange/binance/), Kraken or Bitstamp using your fiat currency (euros, dollars, etc.). These platforms generally offer different[options](https://coinacademy.fr/academie/options-defi-explications/)payment options, such as bank transfers, credit and debit cards, and sometimes other options like PayPal.
- Buying in person: You can also buy bitcoins directly from other people who want to sell them. Platforms like[LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/fr/)connect local buyers and sellers, and you can meet in person to make the exchange.
- Mining: Mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the[blockchain](https://coinacademy.fr/academie/quest-ce-que-blockchain/), and new bitcoins are created as rewards for miners. You can mine bitcoin using your own hardware, but this usually requires technical knowledge and investment in expensive hardware.
- Purchase from an ATM[Bitcoin](https://coinacademy.fr/bitcoin-btc-fondamental/)(ATM): Bitcoin ATMs allow you to purchase bitcoins using cash or a bank card. You can find these ATMs in several cities around the world using a location service like[Coin ATM Radar](https://coinatmradar.com/country/73/bitcoin-atm-france/).
- Accept bitcoin payments: If you have a business or sell goods or services, you can accept bitcoin payments. This allows you to receive bitcoins directly from your customers, without going through an intermediary.

**IN PROGRESS**

- There are multiple ways to obtain bitcoin: buying it on specialized platforms, buying it from other users, by mining bitcoin or receiving payments in bitcoins for example.
- There are a lot of exchange platforms allowing the purchase of bitcoins with different advantages and disadvantages: acquisition price, ease of use, mandatory identity verification, etc.
- It is advisable not to keep your bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies on centralized platforms because in the event of a problem you expose yourself to the partial or total loss of your funds as may have been the case following the falls of the MT.GOX or FTX more recently.
- Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins -\> Not your keys, not your coins. It's as simple as that.
- You can easily send bitcoins from one application to another application, but it will be necessary to pay transaction fees to reward the miners who ensure the proper functioning of the Bitcoin system.
